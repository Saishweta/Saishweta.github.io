In a real world scenario, we believe this could be used by common users to get an idea of different cuisines based on a set of ingredients.\r\n\r\n### *Objectives*\r\nThrough this project, we sought to answer the following questions:\r\n1. How different cuisines may be identified based on certain combination of ingredients?\r\n2. What is the most commonly used ingredient in a cuisine?\r\n3. What is the distribution of ingredients in different countries?\r\n\r\n### *Approach*\r\nWe began our study by exploring the data set from Kaggle website detailing the ingredients and the corresponding cuisines. A series of exploratory analysis was performed with the hope of understanding the association of the variable with one another in the given data set. We used various modeling techniques to identify the best result. During the exploration phase, it was identified that three algorithms may be used to come up with the predictions: One using Random Forest classification, another using Decision Tree classification and third using Support Vector Machine (SVM).\r\n\r\n## **Modelling**\r\n\r\n### *Analysis*\r\nThe data set used for analysis contains type of cuisine and list of ingredients. The data set used for prediction contains the ingredients list, using which we tried to come up with the most accurate cuisine for that list.\r\n\r\nData set used for analysis:\r\n\r\n<-- insert snapshot -->\r\n\r\nData set used for prediction:\r\n\r\n<-- insert snapshot -->\r\n\r\nWe have analyzed 3 different classifiers to model the data namely:\r\n\r\n1. Decision Tree\r\n2. Random Forest\r\n3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)\r\n\r\nDuring the analysis, we identified the performance and accuracy score of individual classifiers. The graph below indicates the score comparison between the classifiers.\r\n\r\n<--insert bar graph-->\r\n\r\nVoila! Found the best classifier!! - SVM it is..\r\n\r\nThe classifier that gave <--accuracy score--> accuracy is SVM, which is the best out of the three. Hence we chose SVM to do our prediction.\r\n\r\nThe following plots show the comparison of cuisine distribution between the data set used for analysis(train data) and the data set used for prediction(test data)\r\n\r\n< -- insert cuisine distribution graph -->\r\n\r\n## **Results**\r\n\r\n<-- write description based on graph -->\r\n\r\n<-- insert ingredient distribution graph -->\r\n\r\n<-- write description based on graph -->\r\n\r\n<-- insert ingredient distribution graph -->\r\n\r\n<-- write description based on graph --> \r\n\r\n<-- insert ingredient-cuisine distribution graph -->\r\n\r\n## **Screencast**\r\n\r\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/c52IOlnPw08/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c52IOlnPw08)\r\n\r\n## **Links**\r\n\r\ngithub\r\n\r\n<-- ipython notebook -->\r\n\r\n<-- json files -->\r\n\r\n<-- result file -->\r\n\r\n## **Future Work**\r\nOur future work may include recipe suggestion along with the cuisine based on a set of ingredients and also to identify how feature selection affects the prediction using various classifiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
